now i will create the AWS free account by using this url
	https://aws.amazon.com/console/

i will create the one EC2 instance its nothing its virsual server

EC2--Elastic compute cloud
			its a web based service that allows business to run application prg in the aws public cloud 
	
	i will give one example
		suppose you buy a one laptop/ desktop means what you will check?
		
			1. OS
				latest orignal os are installed or not 
				
			2.Storage 
				how much storage this laptop
				
			3. RAM/processer 
			
			4. Login by using kery pair method 
			
		same thinks its needed for the create EC2 instance
			normal laptop we are using ISO format OS but server os or virsual os format is AMI (amazon machine image) format.
		
	real time we are  choing the stroarge /cpu based on the client requirment 
		
		i will give one example: 
		
			one of the client required to the gaming application lunch  in the EC2 server means
				we are choocing  high processer cpu because 


		generally 
			linux server storage minimum size is 8 gb
			windows server storage ,minimum size is 30gb		
			
			
	now i created the EC2 instance 
	suppose you want any addinal drive speace means 
	
	which AZ you created the instance same az you choice the volume options
