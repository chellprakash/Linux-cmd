	hi team
		i moving to the next side of the Load balance 
			Load balance is called the Elastic Load balance in the Aws.
				
				generally LB is forward to the internet traffic to the multiple servers (Ec2 instance) down stream.
	one word defination is :  same application runing on the mutliaple servers 

		there are 3 types in the Load balance	
			1. classic LB ---v1 generation ---2009
			2. Application LB ----v2 generation ---2016
			3. Network LB---v2 generation---2017
			
	1. classic LB demo session:
	
	what are prequired of the Classic LB:
		1. you create the minimum 2 EC2 instance
		2. different AZ
		3. install the webserver
		
 Now we are moving to the demo session 
		i created the 2 EC2 instance 
 what is Load balance now i will explain 
 
 refere the paint document :
	can you imagine 4 users access the application in the servers so load balance work is its reduces the internet traffic 
		user 1 requested is go to the server1
		user2 request go to server2
		user 3 req is goto server1
		user4 req go to server2
		
how to check the servers is availbile or not in the LB 
	index.html  this cmd is using check the status of this server.
		inservice means its healthy 
		outservice means its unhealthy
